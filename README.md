Rock paper scissors java project


Initially I did not read the instructions very well. As a result my initial code (roshambo.js) was buggy and I eventually got stuck. This led me to blow it up, via starting over and I ended getting the desired result.

...But in the midst of writing the new rockpaperscissors.js script, I did not do a good job of using git to help track versions. I guess I've found something to focus on in the future.
