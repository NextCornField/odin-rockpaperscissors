Phase 1 - Initial Rock Paper Scissors function
    Set user value to input (accept all variations of case)
    Set computer value to Rock
    write conditional as follows (U = user C = computer)
        U(Rock) > C(Scissors) -> U win
        U(Rock) < C(Paper) -> C win
        U(Rock) = C(Rock) -> Tie

        Repeat logic for U(Paper) & U(Scissors)
    Display who won

Phase 2 - Random Slector for computer
    Assign value for rock paper and Scissors (1-3)
    UJse random number generator, multiply by 3 and ceiling round
